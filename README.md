# OpenGrok Search for Vim

**OpenGrok Search** is a Vim plugin to search the word under the cursor or the currently selected text in a configured OpenGrok instance.

## How to install

I recommend you use one of the several plug-in managing tools for Vim that are out there, like Pathogen, Vundle or VAM.
